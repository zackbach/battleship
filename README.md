This project was created as a part of The Odin Project's Web Development curriculum.

This project was designed to practice test-driven development. This project was also significantly more challenging to code than any of my previous projects. As a result, there are some aspects of it that are suboptimally written (as I did not forsee the problem ahead of time when structuring the program) since a better implementation would require restructuring large portions of the project.

Due to the aforementioned structure issues, I could not use React with this project, so I rendered it using vanilla JavaScript. I have yet to style the game.
